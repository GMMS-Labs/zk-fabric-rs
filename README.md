a Polylithic Syntax Zero Knowledge Joint Proof System

## Module 1: Polylithic Syntax Generation

```
# Polylithic Syntax Generation
Example of a composite statement:
`The car only starts [if] the "start" button [and] the brake pedal is pressed.`
where [.] represents logical relationship between variables (the rest of the words in composite statement).

This represents a logical condition where:
  S: Car starts
  P: "start" button is pressed
  B: brake pedal is pressed

It can be logically modeled as:
  (P ‚àß B) ‚Üí S  or  S ‚Üí (P ‚àß B)
depending on direction of implication.
```

Everything about it, what is Polylithic? How is it generation? pros, goals~, see the [PSG Wiki](wiki/psg.md).

## Module 2: Partitioned Garbled Circuits

can be divided into three categories:-

| Component                | Role                                         | Who Uses It           | Security Goal                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| A. Garbled Circuit       | Encrypt the logic of a function              | Alice (circuit owner) | Hide internal logic & intermediate values |
| B. Partitioned GC Scheme | Split the computation into verifiable parts  | Alice + Verifiers     | Allow distributed evaluation              |
| C. OT Protocol           | Provide input wire keys securely & privately | Bob/Charlie           | Keep input values secret from Alice       |

### A. Garbled circuit Representation

üéØ Sole Purpose:
To model a boolean function as a circuit of logic gates and convert it into an encrypted (garbled) format

‚úÖ Outcome: A garbled version of the circuit that is secure and evaluable only by someone with the correct input keys.

### B. Partition Garbled Circuits Scheme

üéØ Sole Purpose:
To split the full garbled circuit into multiple smaller, independently evaluable partitions to support distributed verification and scalability.

‚úÖ Outcome:
Enables parallel and distributed secure evaluation of large circuits by splitting trust and computation among multiple parties.

### C. Offline Non-Interactive OT Transfer Protocol

üéØ Sole Purpose:
To allow each verifier (e.g., Bob) to obtain exactly one of two possible input keys per wire (either for 0 or 1 input), without revealing their choice to Alice.

Outcome:
Enables private and secure acquisition of input wire keys so that verifiers can evaluate their partitions without leaking input choices or requiring live interaction.

### Status so far:

| Input wire key selection   | ‚ö†Ô∏è (direct)   | ‚ùå (must be OT) |

Understanding the concept, see the [PGC Wiki](wiki/pgc.md).

Note: For this prototype, we assume a trusted single-party execution where the evaluator already knows their inputs. We therefore skip the offline OT phase and directly assign wire keys as if the OT protocol has already been completed. In a full implementation, the OT protocol would be used to allow verifiers to retrieve only the keys corresponding to their inputs in a privacy-preserving way.

‚úÖ Dummy OT works! Bob received the correct key.

### Status So Far...

```
- PSG generates the boolean circuit with hashed variables and operators.
- The circuit is converted into your partitioned_gc::Circuit structure.
- Inputs get paired and prepared properly.
- Garbling assigns keys and garbles the gates correctly.
- Partitioning splits the circuit as expected.
- Protocol runs over the partitions and evaluates them.
- Outputs from partitions are aggregated, resulting in final verification [1] (true).
